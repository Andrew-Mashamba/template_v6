# Modal Z-Index Fix for Active Loans

## Date: August 18, 2025

## Issue
The modal headers in the Active Loans page were appearing behind the project header due to insufficient z-index values.

## Solution Applied

### Changed z-index from `z-40` to `z-50` for:
1. **Detailed Loan Information Modal** (Line 633)
2. **Edit Loan Modal** (Line 531)

### Also added `z-50` to the modal content divs to ensure proper layering.

## Files Modified
- `/resources/views/livewire/active-loan/all-table.blade.php`

## Z-Index Scale Reference
```
z-0     = 0
z-10    = 10
z-20    = 20
z-30    = 30
z-40    = 40    (Previous - too low)
z-50    = 50    (Current - standard for modals)
z-auto  = auto
```

## If Issue Persists

If the modal is still appearing behind the header after this change, you can:

### Option 1: Use a higher arbitrary z-index value
```html
<!-- Change from z-50 to z-[100] or z-[9999] -->
<div class="fixed inset-0 bg-black bg-opacity-50 z-[100] flex items-center justify-center p-4">
    <div class="bg-white rounded-2xl shadow-xl max-w-4xl w-full max-h-[95vh] flex flex-col relative z-[100]">
```

### Option 2: Move the modal outside the parent container
If the modal is inside a parent div with a lower z-index or positioning context, move it to the end of the body:
```blade
@push('modals')
    <!-- Move modal here, outside any parent containers -->
    @if($showDetailsModal && $selectedLoan)
        <!-- Modal content -->
    @endif
@endpush
```

Then in your layout file, add:
```blade
@stack('modals')
```

### Option 3: Check the header z-index
Find the project header component and check its z-index. It might be using a custom high value that needs to be reduced or the modal needs to be higher.

## Testing
1. Navigate to Active Loans page
2. Click on any loan to open the details modal
3. Verify the modal header is fully visible and not hidden behind the project header
4. Test scrolling to ensure the modal stays on top

## Result
The modals should now appear properly on top of all other page elements including the project header.

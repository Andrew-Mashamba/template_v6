# Member Exit Property Conflict Fix (Version 2)

## Problem
The member exit functionality was failing with the following error:
```
number_format(): Argument #1 ($num) must be of type float, Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection given
```

## Root Cause
The dynamic properties set in the `calculateMemberExitData()` method were conflicting with Eloquent relationships in the `ClientsModel`:

- `$member->shares_balance` conflicted with `shares()` relationship
- `$member->savings_balance` conflicted with `savings()` relationship
- `$member->dividends` conflicted with `dividends()` relationship

When the Blade template accessed these properties, Eloquent was returning relationship collections instead of the calculated numeric values.

## Solution

### 1. Renamed All Dynamic Properties

#### Before (Conflicting):
```php
// In calculateMemberExitData method
$member->shares_balance = $shares;        // Conflicts with shares() relationship
$member->savings_balance = $savings;      // Conflicts with savings() relationship
$member->deposits_balance = $deposits;    // Conflicts with deposits() relationship
$member->loan_balance = $loanBalance;     // Conflicts with loans() relationship
$member->unpaid_bills = $unpaidBills;     // Conflicts with bills() relationship
$member->dividends = $dividends;          // Conflicts with dividends() relationship
$member->interest_on_savings = $interestOnSavings; // Conflicts with interestPayables() relationship
$member->total_credits = $totalCredits;
$member->total_debits = $totalDebits;
$member->final_settlement = $finalSettlement;
```

#### After (Unique Names):
```php
// In calculateMemberExitData method
$member->exit_shares_balance = $shares;        // Unique name, no conflict
$member->exit_savings_balance = $savings;      // Unique name, no conflict
$member->exit_deposits_balance = $deposits;    // Unique name, no conflict
$member->exit_loan_balance = $loanBalance;     // Unique name, no conflict
$member->exit_unpaid_bills = $unpaidBills;     // Unique name, no conflict
$member->exit_dividends = $dividends;          // Unique name, no conflict
$member->exit_interest_on_savings = $interestOnSavings; // Unique name, no conflict
$member->exit_total_credits = $totalCredits;
$member->exit_total_debits = $totalDebits;
$member->exit_final_settlement = $finalSettlement;
```

### 2. Updated Process Method

#### Before:
```php
// In processMemberExit method
if ($this->exitMemberDetails->loan_balance > 0) {
    $outstandingObligations[] = 'Outstanding loan balance: TZS ' . number_format($this->exitMemberDetails->loan_balance, 2);
}

if ($this->exitMemberDetails->unpaid_bills > 0) {
    $outstandingObligations[] = 'Unpaid bills: TZS ' . number_format($this->exitMemberDetails->unpaid_bills, 2);
}

$settlementAmount = $this->exitMemberDetails->final_settlement;
```

#### After:
```php
// In processMemberExit method
if ($this->exitMemberDetails->exit_loan_balance > 0) {
    $outstandingObligations[] = 'Outstanding loan balance: TZS ' . number_format($this->exitMemberDetails->exit_loan_balance, 2);
}

if ($this->exitMemberDetails->exit_unpaid_bills > 0) {
    $outstandingObligations[] = 'Unpaid bills: TZS ' . number_format($this->exitMemberDetails->exit_unpaid_bills, 2);
}

$settlementAmount = $this->exitMemberDetails->exit_final_settlement;
```

### 3. Updated Database Insert

#### Before:
```php
'shares_balance' => $this->exitMemberDetails->shares_balance,
'savings_balance' => $this->exitMemberDetails->savings_balance,
'deposits_balance' => $this->exitMemberDetails->deposits_balance,
'loan_balance' => $this->exitMemberDetails->loan_balance,
'unpaid_bills' => $this->exitMemberDetails->unpaid_bills,
'dividends' => $this->exitMemberDetails->dividends,
'interest_on_savings' => $this->exitMemberDetails->interest_on_savings,
'total_credits' => $this->exitMemberDetails->total_credits,
'total_debits' => $this->exitMemberDetails->total_debits,
```

#### After:
```php
'shares_balance' => $this->exitMemberDetails->exit_shares_balance,
'savings_balance' => $this->exitMemberDetails->exit_savings_balance,
'deposits_balance' => $this->exitMemberDetails->exit_deposits_balance,
'loan_balance' => $this->exitMemberDetails->exit_loan_balance,
'unpaid_bills' => $this->exitMemberDetails->exit_unpaid_bills,
'dividends' => $this->exitMemberDetails->exit_dividends,
'interest_on_savings' => $this->exitMemberDetails->exit_interest_on_savings,
'total_credits' => $this->exitMemberDetails->exit_total_credits,
'total_debits' => $this->exitMemberDetails->exit_total_debits,
```

### 4. Updated Blade Template

#### Before:
```php
<!-- In clients.blade.php -->
TZS {{ number_format($exitMemberDetails->shares_balance ?? 0, 2) }}
TZS {{ number_format($exitMemberDetails->savings_balance ?? 0, 2) }}
TZS {{ number_format($exitMemberDetails->deposits_balance ?? 0, 2) }}
TZS {{ number_format($exitMemberDetails->dividends ?? 0, 2) }}
TZS {{ number_format($exitMemberDetails->interest_on_savings ?? 0, 2) }}
TZS {{ number_format($exitMemberDetails->total_credits ?? 0, 2) }}
TZS {{ number_format($exitMemberDetails->loan_balance ?? 0, 2) }}
TZS {{ number_format($exitMemberDetails->unpaid_bills ?? 0, 2) }}
TZS {{ number_format($exitMemberDetails->total_debits ?? 0, 2) }}
TZS {{ number_format($exitMemberDetails->final_settlement ?? 0, 2) }}
```

#### After:
```php
<!-- In clients.blade.php -->
TZS {{ number_format($exitMemberDetails->exit_shares_balance ?? 0, 2) }}
TZS {{ number_format($exitMemberDetails->exit_savings_balance ?? 0, 2) }}
TZS {{ number_format($exitMemberDetails->exit_deposits_balance ?? 0, 2) }}
TZS {{ number_format($exitMemberDetails->exit_dividends ?? 0, 2) }}
TZS {{ number_format($exitMemberDetails->exit_interest_on_savings ?? 0, 2) }}
TZS {{ number_format($exitMemberDetails->exit_total_credits ?? 0, 2) }}
TZS {{ number_format($exitMemberDetails->exit_loan_balance ?? 0, 2) }}
TZS {{ number_format($exitMemberDetails->exit_unpaid_bills ?? 0, 2) }}
TZS {{ number_format($exitMemberDetails->exit_total_debits ?? 0, 2) }}
TZS {{ number_format($exitMemberDetails->exit_final_settlement ?? 0, 2) }}
```

## Key Changes

### 1. Property Naming Convention
- **Dynamic Properties**: Use `exit_` prefix for all calculated values
- **Eloquent Relationships**: Keep original relationship names unchanged
- **Clear Separation**: No ambiguity between calculated values and relationships

### 2. Data Type Safety
- **Dynamic Properties**: Always numeric values (string/integer/double)
- **Eloquent Relationships**: Always Eloquent Collections
- **No Conflicts**: Unique property names prevent relationship interference

### 3. Comprehensive Coverage
- **All Properties**: Every calculated value uses the `exit_` prefix
- **Consistent Naming**: Uniform naming convention throughout
- **Future-Proof**: Prevents similar conflicts in the future

## Testing Results

### Sample Member (00006) Properties:
```php
Member: GONZA LO
Shares Balance: 50,000.00 (type: string)
Savings Balance: 0.00 (type: integer)
Final Settlement: -189,260.00 (type: double)
```

### Property Access:
```php
// Dynamic properties (numeric values)
$member->exit_shares_balance    // 50000 (string)
$member->exit_savings_balance   // 0 (integer)
$member->exit_final_settlement  // -189260 (double)

// Eloquent relationships (collections)
$member->shares                 // Eloquent Collection
$member->savings                // Eloquent Collection
$member->dividends              // Eloquent Collection
```

## Files Modified

2. **`resources/views/livewire/clients/clients.blade.php`**
   - Updated all template references to use `exit_` prefixed properties
   - Updated validation conditions to use new property names

## Benefits

### 1. No Property Conflicts
- **Unique Names**: All calculated values use `exit_` prefix
- **No Ambiguity**: Clear separation from Eloquent relationships
- **Predictable Access**: Consistent property access patterns

### 2. Type Safety
- **Numeric Values**: `number_format()` receives proper numeric types
- **No Runtime Errors**: Eliminates collection type errors

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Test member exit calculation with new property names
php artisan tinker --execute="
\$member = App\Models\ClientsModel::where('client_number', '00006')->first();
if(\$member) {
    \$shares = DB::table('accounts')
        ->where('client_number', \$member->client_number)
        ->where('product_number', '1000')
        ->whereIn('status', ['ACTIVE', 'PENDING'])
        ->sum(DB::raw('CAST(balance AS DECIMAL)'));
    
    \$member->exit_shares_balance = \$shares;
    
    echo 'Shares Balance: ' . number_format(\$member->exit_shares_balance, 2) . ' (type: ' . gettype(\$member->exit_shares_balance) . ')' . PHP_EOL;
    echo 'Relationship: ' . gettype(\$member->shares) . PHP_EOL;
}
"
```

## Related Fixes

This fix addresses the same issue as the previous property conflict fix but with a more comprehensive approach:

1. **First Fix**: Renamed only `shares` and `savings` properties
2. **Second Fix**: Renamed ALL calculated properties with `exit_` prefix
3. **Complete Solution**: Eliminates all potential conflicts with Eloquent relationships

The member exit functionality now works correctly with proper data types and no conflicts between calculated values and Eloquent relationships.

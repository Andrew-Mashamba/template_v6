# Trade Payables Component - Complete Fix Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all fixes applied to the TradeAndOtherPayables component and its associated blade view to ensure full compatibility with the database structure and component logic.

## Files Modified
1. `/app/Http/Livewire/Accounting/TradeAndOtherPayables.php`
2. `/resources/views/livewire/accounting/trade-payables.blade.php`

## Key Issues Resolved

### 1. Database Table References
**Fixed:** All references updated from `payables` to `trade_payables` table
- Component queries now use `DB::table('trade_payables')`
- Schema checks use `Schema::hasTable('trade_payables')`

### 2. Vendor Table Column Mapping
**Issue:** Component was looking for `vendor_name` column in vendors table
**Fix:** Changed to use `organization_name` column which exists in vendors table

### 3. Trade Payables Table Column Mapping
**Mapped columns correctly:**
```
Component Property → Database Column
invoice_number → bill_number
invoice_date → bill_date
total_amount → amount
balance_due → balance
amount_paid → paid_amount
```

### 4. View File References
**Issue:** Component was trying to render non-existent view
**Fix:** Updated to use existing `livewire.accounting.trade-payables` view

### 5. Blade View Variable and Method Mismatches

#### Fixed Variable References:
- `$isEdit` → `$editMode` (matches component property)
- `wire:model="invoice_number"` → `wire:model="bill_number"`
- `wire:model="amount"` → `wire:model="payment_amount"` (in payment modal)
- `wire:model="description"` → `wire:model="payment_notes"` (in payment modal)

#### Fixed Method Calls:
- `wire:click="markAsPaid()"` → `wire:click="openPaymentModal()"`
- `wire:click="makePayment"` → `wire:click="processPayment"`
- `wire:click="$toggle('payModal')"` → `wire:click="$toggle('showPaymentModal')"`

#### Fixed Modal Variable:
- `@if($this->payModal)` → `@if($showPaymentModal)`

### 6. Account Selection Updates
**Removed:** All references to `setup_accounts` table
**Replaced with:** Direct queries to `accounts` table

#### Account Type Queries:
- Liability accounts: `DB::table('accounts')->where('account_type', 'LIABILITY')`
- Cash/Bank accounts: `DB::table('accounts')->where('is_bank_account', true)`
- Expense accounts: `DB::table('accounts')->where('account_type', 'EXPENSE')`

### 7. Payment Modal Enhancements
**Added:** Payment account selection dropdown in payment modal
```blade
<select wire:model.defer="payment_account_id">
    @foreach(DB::table('accounts')->where('is_bank_account', true)->where('status', 'ACTIVE')->get() as $account)
        <option value="{{ $account->id }}">{{ $account->account_name }}</option>
    @endforeach
</select>
```

### 8. Component Validation Rules
**Updated:** Removed non-existent columns from validation
- Removed `expense_account_id` and `payable_account_id` requirements
- Updated to validate `bill_number` instead of `invoice_number`
- Made `currency` nullable since it may not always be required

### 9. PostgreSQL Compatibility
**Fixed SQL syntax:**
- `DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), ...)` → `DATE_PART('day', CURRENT_DATE - ...)`
- `AVG(DATEDIFF(...))` → `AVG(DATE_PART('day', ...))`

## Component Flow

### Create/Edit Flow:
1. User fills form with vendor details and bill information
2. Bill number is auto-generated or manually entered
3. Payment type selection determines which accounts to show
4. Data saves to `trade_payables` table with correct column mapping
5. Integration with BalanceSheetItemIntegrationService for GL posting

### Payment Flow:
1. User clicks "Pay" button → calls `openPaymentModal()`
2. Payment modal shows with payment amount and account selection
3. User enters payment details
4. "Proceed" button → calls `processPayment()`
5. Updates trade_payables balance and status
6. Creates GL entries for payment

## Database Structure Alignment

### Trade Payables Table Columns Used:
- `id`, `bill_number`, `vendor_name`, `vendor_id`
- `amount`, `paid_amount`, `balance`
- `bill_date`, `due_date`, `payment_terms`
- `purchase_order_number`, `account_number`
- `description`, `status`
- `created_by`, `updated_by`, `created_at`, `updated_at`

### Accounts Table Integration:
- Uses `account_type` field to filter account types
- Uses `is_bank_account` field to identify bank accounts
- Uses `status` field to show only ACTIVE accounts

## Testing Verification

### Component Initialization:
```php
$component = new App\Http\Livewire\Accounting\TradeAndOtherPayables();
$component->mount();
// ✅ Initializes without errors
```

### View Rendering:
```php
$component->render();
// ✅ Renders view without database errors
```

### Key Features Working:
- ✅ Vendor list loads from vendors table
- ✅ Bill creation with auto-generated bill numbers
- ✅ Edit functionality with correct field mapping
- ✅ Payment modal with account selection
- ✅ Delete functionality
- ✅ Statistics calculation
- ✅ Cash flow projection
- ✅ Integration with GL through BalanceSheetItemIntegrationService

## Summary
All database references, column mappings, view variables, and method calls have been aligned between the TradeAndOtherPayables component and its blade view. The component now:
1. Uses correct database tables (trade_payables, vendors, accounts)
2. Maps all fields to correct database columns
3. Has matching variable and method names between PHP and Blade
4. Properly integrates with the accounts table instead of setup_accounts
5. Supports full CRUD operations with proper GL integration

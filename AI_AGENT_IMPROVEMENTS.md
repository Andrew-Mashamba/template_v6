# AI Agent Service Improvements

Based on the latest research from GitHub and industry best practices for LLM database chat implementations (2024-2025), the following improvements have been made to the AiAgentService.php:

## 1. Schema Representation (CREATE TABLE Format)

**Previous**: Schema was returned as JSON array of column information
**Improved**: Now generates CREATE TABLE statements that are familiar to LLMs

```php
// Example output:
-- Tracks system users with authentication and profile information
CREATE TABLE users (
    id bigint NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    name varchar(255),
    email varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at timestamp DEFAULT now()
);
```

**Benefits**:
- LLMs are trained on SQL documentation using CREATE TABLE format
- More concise and cheaper to run
- Better accuracy in SQL generation

## 2. Few-Shot Example Management

**Added**: Dynamic few-shot example selection based on query patterns

```php
private function getFewShotExamples($question, $tableNames)
```

**Features**:
- Only adds examples when needed (not by default)
- Matches examples based on query characteristics (joins, aggregations)
- Limits to 2 examples to avoid prompt bloat
- Uses cached successful queries as examples

## 3. Self-Learning Capabilities

**Added**: Automatic storage of successful queries for future use

```php
public function storeSuccessfulQuery($question, $sql, $tableNames)
```

**Features**:
- Stores successful query patterns with metadata
- Analyzes query characteristics (aggregations, joins)
- Maintains last 100 successful queries
- 7-day cache retention
- Avoids duplicate storage

## 4. Improved Prompt Engineering

**Previous**: Complex, verbose prompts
**Improved**: Clear, simple instructions following best practices

```php
// Best practice: Clear, simple instructions
$prompt = "You are a PostgreSQL expert. Generate SQL queries to answer the user's question.\n\n";
```

**Changes**:
- Removed redundant instructions
- Simplified format requirements
- Added examples only when needed
- Focus on CREATE TABLE schema format

## 5. Enhanced Error Tracking

**Added**: Error pattern tracking for continuous improvement

```php
private function trackError($errorType, $context)
```

**Features**:
- Tracks common error patterns (invalid columns, tables)
- Stores error frequency and context
- Helps identify areas needing prompt improvement
- Maintains last 50 error patterns

## 6. RAG-Based Table Identification

**Improved**: Better caching and semantic matching

```php
// Check cache first for similar questions
$cacheKey = 'ai_table_identification_' . md5($question);
$cachedTables = Cache::get($cacheKey);
```

**Features**:
- Caches table identification results (1 hour)
- Reduces redundant LLM calls
- Improves response time

## 7. Security & Validation

**Maintained**: Strong table validation and security measures

- Only allows queries on whitelisted tables
- Validates all SQL queries before execution
- Filters out invalid table references
- Prevents SQL injection through parameterized queries

## Usage Example

```php
// The service now automatically:
// 1. Identifies relevant tables with caching
// 2. Generates CREATE TABLE schemas
// 3. Adds few-shot examples if needed
// 4. Generates SQL queries
// 5. Stores successful queries for self-learning
// 6. Tracks errors for improvement

$result = $aiAgent->processQuestionWithSql(
    "How many active members have loans?",
    $context
);
```

## Performance Improvements

1. **Reduced Token Usage**: CREATE TABLE format uses fewer tokens
2. **Better Accuracy**: Familiar format improves SQL generation
3. **Faster Responses**: Caching reduces redundant processing
4. **Continuous Learning**: Self-improves over time

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement vector embeddings for better semantic matching
2. Add more sophisticated error correction
3. Implement multi-agent architecture for complex queries
4. Add query result caching for frequently asked questions

These improvements align with the latest best practices from leading implementations like Vanna AI, AWS best practices for Text-to-SQL, and research from 2024-2025.

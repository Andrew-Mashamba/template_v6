2. The AI should indicate when data is not available rather than making up numbers
3. Responses should be consistent across multiple asks of the same question
4. The AI should handle variations in how questions are asked
5. The system should respect data privacy and access controls
6. Performance should be acceptable even for complex queries
7. The AI should provide helpful context when data seems unusual or concerning

---

- Answer 95% of these questions accurately
- Respond within 5 seconds for simple queries
- Respond within 15 seconds for complex analytical queries
- Provide consistent answers across multiple sessions

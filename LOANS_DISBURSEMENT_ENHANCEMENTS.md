# Loans Disbursement System Enhancements

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive enhancements made to the loans disbursement system (`resources/views/livewire/accounting/loans-disbursement.blade.php`) based on the knowledge and best practices developed from the loan assessment system.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. **Enhanced Loan Type Detection**
- **Improved Recognition**: Now properly handles multiple variations of loan types:
  - **Top-up**: `['Top-up', 'TopUp', 'Top Up']`
  - **Restructure**: `['Restructure', 'Restructuring']`
  - **New**: Standard new loan processing

### 2. **Advanced Calculation Methods**

#### **Top-Up Amount Calculation** (`calculateTopUpAmount`)
```php
// Priority-based calculation system:
// 1. Direct field: loan->top_up_amount
// 2. Account balance: Calculate from top_up_loan_id
// 3. Assessment data: JSON stored values
// 4. Fallback: selectedLoan field
```

#### **Restructuring Amount Calculation** (`calculateRestructuringAmount`)
```php
// Enhanced calculation logic:
// 1. Direct field: loan->restructure_amount
// 2. Dynamic calculation: Outstanding balance + Arrears
// 3. Assessment data: JSON stored values
// 4. Original loan reference: loan->restructure_loan_id (not restructured_loan_id)
```

#### **Insurance Calculation for Restructure Loans** (`calculateInsuranceTenureForRestructure`)
```php
// Special calculation for restructure loans:
// 1. Calculate remaining time from original loan
// 2. Insurance tenure = New tenure - Remaining time
// 3. Insurance = Monthly rate × Insurance tenure
// 4. Formula: (New tenure - Remaining months) × Monthly insurance rate
```

#### **Penalty Amount Calculation** (`calculatePenaltyAmount`)
```php
// New method for top-up loans:
// 1. Direct field: loan->top_up_penalty_amount
// 2. Calculated: 5% of top-up amount (configurable)
```

#### **Net Disbursement Calculation for Top-Up Loans**
```php
// Corrected formula for top-up loans:
// Net Disbursement = Approved Amount - Total Deductions - Top-Up Loan Balance - Early Settlement Penalty
// Note: Top-Up Loan Balance already includes arrears, so no separate arrears deduction needed
```

#### **Double Entry Accounting for Top-Up Loans**
```php
// Enhanced double entry accounting for top-up loans:

// 1. Top-Up Loan Balance Transaction:
//    Debit: Original Loan Account ($loan->loan_account_number)
//    Credit: Selected Disbursement Account (from modal)
//    Amount: Top-up amount

// 2. Early Settlement Penalty Transaction:
//    Debit: Charges Account (from loan product)
//    Credit: Selected Disbursement Account (from modal)
//    Amount: Penalty amount (typically 5% of top-up amount)

// 3. Net Disbursement Transaction:
//    Debit: New Loan Account
//    Credit: Selected Disbursement Account (for external) or Member Deposit Account (for cash)
//    Amount: Net disbursement amount
```

#### **Double Entry Accounting for Restructuring Loans**
```php
// Restructuring loans are processed like new loans, but with special main disbursement:

// 1. Charges Transaction:
//    Debit: Charges Account
//    Credit: Selected Disbursement Account (from modal)
//    Amount: Charges amount

// 2. Insurance Transaction:
//    Debit: Insurance Account
//    Credit: Selected Disbursement Account (from modal)
//    Amount: Insurance amount

// 3. First Interest Transaction:
//    Debit: Interest Account
//    Credit: Selected Disbursement Account (from modal)
//    Amount: First interest amount

// 4. Main Disbursement Transaction (SPECIAL):
//    Debit: New Loan Account
//    Credit: Original Loan Account ($originalLoan->loan_account_number)
//    Amount: Net disbursement amount

// 5. Original Loan Closure:
//    - Close all loan schedules (status = CLOSED)
//    - Close original loan (status = CLOSED)
//    - No separate double entry transaction for restructuring amount
```

### 3. **Enhanced UI Components**

#### **Loan Type Information Sections**
- **Topped-Up Loan Information**: Displays original loan details, outstanding balance, penalty, and total to top-up
- **Restructured Loan Information**: Shows original loan details, outstanding balance, arrears, and total to restructure

#### **Improved Deduction Breakdown**
- **Fresh Calculations**: All values calculated in real-time
- **Priority-Based Logic**: Consistent with assessment system
- **Enhanced Display**: Better visual hierarchy and information organization

### 4. **Data Flow Improvements**

#### **Calculation Priority System**
1. **Direct Database Fields**: Use stored values when available
2. **Dynamic Calculations**: Real-time computation from related data
3. **Assessment Data**: Fallback to JSON stored values
4. **Default Values**: Safe fallbacks for missing data

#### **Consistent Variable Handling**
- **Top-Up Amount**: `$topUpAmount` with proper calculation logic
- **Penalty Amount**: `$penaltyAmount` with percentage-based calculation
- **Restructuring Amount**: `$restructuringAmount` with outstanding + arrears logic

### 5. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs for debugging
- **Graceful Degradation**: Safe fallbacks for missing data
- **Validation**: Proper data validation before calculations

## Technical Implementation

### **Backend Enhancements** (`LoansDisbursement.php`)

#### **New Methods Added**
```php
private function calculateTopUpAmount($loan)
private function calculateRestructuringAmount($loan)
private function calculatePenaltyAmount($loan)
private function processPenaltyTransaction($transactionService, $amount, $chargesAccount)
private function processRestructuringLoanClosure($amount)
```

#### **Enhanced Calculation Flow**
```php
private function calculateAllDeductions($loan)
{
    // 1. Charges
    // 2. Insurance
    // 3. First Interest
    // 4. Top-up Amount (ENHANCED)
    // 5. Closed Loan Balance
    // 6. Outside Settlements

{
    // 1. Process charges
    // 2. Process insurance
    // 3. Process first interest
    // 4. Process outside settlements
    // 5. Process top-up loan closure (ENHANCED - Double Entry)
    // 6. Process early settlement penalty (NEW - Double Entry)
    // 7. Process restructuring loan closure (ENHANCED - No Double Entry)
    // 8. Process main disbursement transaction (ENHANCED - Special for Restructuring)
}
```
    // 8. Early Settlement Penalty (NEW)
}
```

### **Frontend Enhancements** (`loans-disbursement.blade.php`)

#### **New UI Sections**
- **Loan Type Information**: Contextual information based on loan type
- **Enhanced Deduction Display**: Real-time calculations with proper formatting
- **Improved Visual Hierarchy**: Better organization and readability

#### **Calculation Logic in View**
```php
@php
    // Top-up amount calculation
    $topUpAmount = 0;
    if (in_array($loan->loan_type_2 ?? '', ['Top-up', 'TopUp', 'Top Up'])) {
        // Priority-based calculation logic
    }
    
    // Penalty amount calculation
    $penaltyAmount = 0;
    if (in_array($loan->loan_type_2 ?? '', ['Top-up', 'TopUp', 'Top Up'])) {
        // Percentage-based penalty calculation
    }
    
    // Restructuring amount calculation
    $restructuringAmount = 0;
    if (in_array($loan->loan_type_2 ?? '', ['Restructure', 'Restructuring'])) {
        // Outstanding + arrears calculation
    }
@endphp
```

## **Recent Enhancement: Disbursement Account Selection**

### **Overview**
All loan disbursement transactions now use the **selected disbursement account from the modal** instead of the hardcoded bank account from the institutions table.

### **Key Changes**
```php
// Before: Hardcoded bank account from institutions table
$bankAccount = DB::table('institutions')->where('id', '1')->value('operations_account');

// After: Selected disbursement account from modal
if (empty($this->bank_account)) {
    throw new \Exception('Disbursement account not selected for transaction.');
}
$bankAccount = $this->bank_account;
```

### **Updated Methods**
- `processChargesTransaction()` - Uses selected disbursement account
- `processInsuranceTransaction()` - Uses selected disbursement account  
- `processFirstInterestTransaction()` - Uses selected disbursement account
- `processOutsideSettlementsTransaction()` - Uses selected disbursement account
- `processTopUpLoanTransaction()` - Uses selected disbursement account
- `processPenaltyTransaction()` - Uses selected disbursement account
- `postToLedger()` - Uses selected disbursement account for main disbursement

### **Benefits**
1. **Flexibility**: Users can select which account to use for disbursements
2. **Control**: Better control over fund allocation
3. **Transparency**: Clear visibility of which account is being used
4. **Validation**: Ensures disbursement account is selected before processing

## **Critical Fix: Database Column Names**

### **Issue**
The loan disbursement process was failing with the error:
```
SQLSTATE[42703]: Undefined column: 7 ERROR: column "closed_date" of relation "loans" does not exist
```

### **Root Cause**
The code was trying to update non-existent columns in the `loans` table:
- `closed_date` column doesn't exist (should be `closure_date`)
- `closed_by` column doesn't exist

### **Fix Applied**
```php
// Before (causing error):
DB::table('loans')->where('id', $originalLoan->id)->update([
    'status' => 'CLOSED',
    'closed_date' => now(),        // ❌ Column doesn't exist
    'closed_by' => auth()->id()    // ❌ Column doesn't exist
]);

// After (fixed):
DB::table('loans')->where('id', $originalLoan->id)->update([
    'status' => 'CLOSED',
    'closure_date' => now()->toDateString(),  // ✅ Correct column name
    'updated_at' => now()                     // ✅ Track changes
]);

// Before (causing error):
DB::table('loans')->where('id', $loanID)->update([
    'restructure_loan_id' => $originalLoan->id,
    'restructuring_amount' => $amount,        // ❌ Column doesn't exist
    'is_restructured_loan' => true            // ❌ Column doesn't exist
]);

// After (fixed):
DB::table('loans')->where('id', $loanID)->update([
    'restructure_loan_id' => $originalLoan->id,
    'restructure_amount' => $amount,          // ✅ Correct column name
    'updated_at' => now()                     // ✅ Track changes
]);
```

### **Methods Fixed**
- `processTopUpLoanTransaction()` - Fixed loan closure update
- `processRestructuringLoanClosure()` - Fixed loan closure update

### **Database Schema**
The `loans` table has:
- ✅ `closure_date` (date) - for tracking when loan was closed
- ✅ `status` (character varying) - for loan status
- ✅ `updated_at` (timestamp) - for tracking changes
- ✅ `restructure_amount` (numeric) - for restructuring amount
- ✅ `restructure_loan_id` (bigint) - for original loan reference
- ❌ `closed_date` - doesn't exist
- ❌ `closed_by` - doesn't exist
- ❌ `restructuring_amount` - doesn't exist (should be `restructure_amount`)
- ❌ `is_restructured_loan` - doesn't exist

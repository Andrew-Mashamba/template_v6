# Financial Insurance Component Fix

## Error Fixed: Undefined variable $predefinedTypes

### Root Cause
The `$predefinedTypes` array was declared as a `protected` property in the FinancialInsurance component, making it inaccessible to the Blade view.

### Solution Applied
Changed the visibility of `$predefinedTypes` from `protected` to `public`:

```php
// Before:
protected $predefinedTypes = [
    'credit_life' => 'Credit Life Insurance',
    // ...
];

// After:
public $predefinedTypes = [
    'credit_life' => 'Credit Life Insurance',
    'loan_protection' => 'Loan Protection Insurance',
    'deposit_insurance' => 'Deposit Insurance',
    'property_insurance' => 'Property Insurance',
    'vehicle_insurance' => 'Vehicle Insurance',
    'fidelity_guarantee' => 'Fidelity Guarantee',
    'cash_in_transit' => 'Cash in Transit',
    'directors_liability' => 'Directors & Officers Liability',
    'professional_indemnity' => 'Professional Indemnity',
    'cyber_insurance' => 'Cyber Insurance',
    'business_interruption' => 'Business Interruption',
    'key_person' => 'Key Person Insurance'
];
```

## Why This Fix Works
In Laravel Livewire:
- **Public properties** are automatically available to the Blade view
- **Protected/Private properties** are not accessible in the view
- The view was trying to iterate over `$predefinedTypes` in a foreach loop at line 175

## Verification
✅ Component mounts without errors
✅ The `$predefinedTypes` variable is now accessible in the view
✅ Other variables (`$activeTab`, `$insurancePolicies`, `$recentClaims`) are properly defined
✅ No other undefined variable errors detected

## Files Modified
- `/app/Http/Livewire/Accounting/FinancialInsurance.php` - Line 95: Changed visibility from `protected` to `public`

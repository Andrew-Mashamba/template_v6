# âœ… Daily Activities Scheduler Setup Complete

## Changes Made (2025-09-07)

### 1. **Schedule Time Updated**
- **Changed from**: 23:55 (11:55 PM)
- **Changed to**: 00:05 (12:05 AM)
- **File modified**: `app/Console/Kernel.php`

### 2. **Cron Job Installed**
The Laravel scheduler is now running automatically:
```bash
* * * * * cd /Volumes/DATA/PROJECTS/SACCOS/SYSTEMS/SACCOS_CORE_SYSTEM && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

This cron job runs every minute and triggers the Laravel scheduler, which will execute `system:daily-activities` at 00:05 every day.

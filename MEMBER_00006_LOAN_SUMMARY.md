1. **Past Due Installments**: Schedules 1-3 are past due but marked as completed
2. **Partial Payments**: Schedules 4-6 have partial payments creating arrears
3. **No Payments**: Schedules 7+ have no payments, creating full arrears

### Arrears Calculation Method
```php
// Days in arrears calculation
$daysInArrears = $installmentDate->isPast() ? now()->diffInDays($installmentDate) : 0;

// Amount in arrears calculation
$amountInArrears = $schedule->installment - ($schedule->payment ?? 0);
```

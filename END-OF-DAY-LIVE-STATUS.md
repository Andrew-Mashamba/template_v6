# End-of-Day Live Status System - Implementation Complete

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Database Tracking System**
- Created `daily_activity_status` table to track all 18 end-of-day processes
- Stores status, progress, execution times, errors, and metadata
- Tracks who triggered the activity (manual, scheduled, system)

### 2. **Live UI Component**
Updated the End-of-Day Livewire component with:
- **Real-time status display** for all 18 activities
- **Auto-refresh mechanism** (every 5 seconds when running)
- **Overall progress bar** showing completion percentage
- **Manual trigger button** to run activities on-demand
- **Visual indicators**:
  - ✓ Completed (green)
  - ↻ Running (blue with spinning icon)
  - ✗ Failed (red)
  - ○ Pending (yellow)

### 3. **Progress Tracking Service**
Created `TracksActivityProgress` trait that:
- Tracks start/completion of each activity
- Updates progress in real-time
- Records execution times
- Captures and displays errors

### 4. **Enhanced Features**

#### Live Status Information
- **Last Run**: Shows when activities last completed
- **Next Run**: Displays next scheduled time (00:05 daily)
- **Overall Progress**: Percentage of completed activities
- **Per-Activity Details**:
  - Progress percentage
  - Records processed/total
  - Execution time
  - Error messages (if failed)

#### User Controls
- **Run Now Button**: Manually trigger all activities
- **Auto-refresh Toggle**: Enable/disable live updates
- **Status Badges**: Visual feedback for each process state

## 📊 How It Works

### Automatic Execution (Daily at 00:05)
1. Cron triggers Laravel scheduler
2. `system:daily-activities` command runs
3. Each activity updates its status in database
4. UI auto-refreshes to show progress

### Manual Execution (Via UI)
1. User clicks "RUN NOW" button
2. Job dispatched to queue
3. Activities run with "manual" trigger flag
4. UI auto-refreshes every 5 seconds
5. Live progress displayed as activities complete

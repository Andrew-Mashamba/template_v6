# Top-up Loan Guarantor & Collateral Data Loading Fixes

## Date: January 2025

## Issue Description
The Top-up loan type was not properly preloading existing guarantor and collateral data as expected. When users selected "Top-up" loan type, the system was not filtering for loans with existing collateral and was not loading the existing guarantor and collateral information.

**Additional Issue**: The "Self Guarantee" option was not pre-selected by default when users entered the Guarantor & Collateral section.

**Additional Issue**: The `loan_type_2` field was not being set correctly for Restructure loans.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Incorrect Loan Filtering**: The `loadExistingLoans()` method was not filtering for loans that have existing collateral
2. **Missing Data Loading Triggers**: No automatic loading of existing guarantor/collateral data when a Top-up loan was selected
3. **Inconsistent Status Filtering**: Different status filters were being applied inconsistently
4. **Guarantor Type Reset**: The `resetCollateralFormFields()` method was resetting `guarantorType` to empty string instead of preserving the default value
5. **Blade Template Data Type Mismatch**: The template was checking for objects but data was being loaded as arrays
6. **Loan Type 2 Field Assignment**: The `loan_type_2` field was using fallback logic instead of the original user selection

## Database Structure
- **loans table**: Contains loan records with status field
- **loan_guarantors table**: Links loans to guarantors with status field
- **loan_collaterals table**: Links guarantors to collateral with status field

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced `loadExistingLoans()` Method

**File**: `app/Http/Livewire/Dashboard/LoanApplication.php`

**Changes**:
- Added collateral filtering for Top-up loans using `whereExists` clause
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Enhanced display text to show collateral amounts
- Improved status filtering consistency

**Key Code Changes**:
```php
// For Top-up loans, only show loans that have existing collateral
if ($this->loanType === 'Top-up') {
    $currentUserLoansQuery->whereExists(function ($query) {
        $query->select(DB::raw(1))
              ->from('loan_guarantors')
              ->join('loan_collaterals', 'loan_guarantors.id', '=', 'loan_collaterals.loan_guarantor_id')
              ->whereRaw('loan_guarantors.loan_id = loans.id')
              ->where('loan_guarantors.status', 'active')
              ->where('loan_collaterals.status', 'active');
    });
}
```

### 2. Added Automatic Data Loading Triggers

**New Methods Added**:

#### `updatedSelectedLoanForTopUp($value)`
- Automatically loads existing guarantor and collateral data when a Top-up loan is selected
- Calls `loadExistingGuarantorData()` and `processTopUp()`
- Includes comprehensive logging

#### `updatedSelectedLoanForRestructure($value)`
- Similar functionality for Restructure loans
- Automatically loads existing data when a restructure loan is selected

#### `updatedLoanType($value)`
- Clears existing data when loan type changes
- Reloads existing loans for the new loan type
- Ensures clean state transitions

### 3. Enhanced Logging and Debugging

**Added throughout the codebase**:
- Detailed logging for loan selection changes
- Collateral data loading verification
- Status tracking for debugging

### 4. Fixed Guarantor Type Default Selection

**Issue**: "Self Guarantee" option was not pre-selected by default

**Root Cause**: The `resetCollateralFormFields()` method was resetting `guarantorType` to empty string

**Fix Applied**:
```php
// Before
$this->guarantorType = '';

// After  
$this->guarantorType = 'self_guarantee'; // Always default to self guarantee
```

**Additional Fixes**:
- Updated `updatedCurrentStep()` method to ensure guarantor type is set to default when entering step 2
- Fixed all reset methods to preserve the default guarantor type

### 5. Fixed Blade Template Data Type Mismatch

**Issue**: Existing collateral was showing as 0 because template was checking for objects but data was arrays

**Root Cause**: Data loaded as arrays but template checked `is_object($collateral)`

**Fix Applied**:
```php
// Before
if (is_object($collateral)) {
    if (in_array($collateral->collateral_type, ['savings', 'deposits', 'shares'])) {
        $existingAccountCollateral += floatval($collateral->collateral_amount);
    }
}

// After
if (is_array($collateral)) {
    if (in_array($collateral['collateral_type'], ['savings', 'deposits', 'shares'])) {
        $existingAccountCollateral += floatval($collateral['collateral_amount']);
    }
}
```

### 6. Fixed Loan Type 2 Field Assignment

**Issue**: `loan_type_2` field was not being set correctly for Restructure loans

**Root Cause**: The field was using fallback logic `$this->loan_type_2 ?? $this->loanType` instead of directly using the user selection

**Fix Applied**:
```php
// Before
'loan_type_2' => $this->loan_type_2 ?? $this->loanType, // textual type used by listing components

// After
'loan_type_2' => $this->loanType, // textual type used by listing components (original user selection)
```

**Explanation**:
- `loan_type`: Contains system codes like `'RESTRUCTURED'`, `'TOPUP'`, `'TAKEOVER'`, `'New'`
- `loan_type_2`: Contains original user selections like `'Restructure'`, `'Top-up'`, `'Takeover'`, `'New'`
- This ensures proper display in listing components while maintaining system logic

## Test Results

### Before Fix:
- Top-up loans showed all active loans regardless of collateral
- No existing guarantor/collateral data was preloaded
- Users had to manually provide all collateral information
- "Self Guarantee" was not pre-selected
- Existing collateral showed as 0 in summary table
- `loan_type_2` field had incorrect values for Restructure loans

### After Fix:
- **5 Top-up eligible loans** found for client 10003 (with existing collateral)
- **3 Active loans** with collateral across all clients
- **Automatic data loading** when Top-up loan is selected
- **Existing collateral display** in the UI
- **"Self Guarantee" pre-selected** by default
- **Existing collateral amounts** properly calculated and displayed
- **`loan_type_2` field** correctly set to user selection (e.g., "Restructure")

### Test Data Verified:
```
Client 10003 Top-up Eligible Loans:
- ID: 22, Loan ID: LN202508195775, Amount: 48,000,000, Collateral: 6,000,000
- ID: 9,  Loan ID: LN202508187894, Amount: 20,000,000, Collateral: 5,000,000
- ID: 7,  Loan ID: LN202508174418, Amount: 3,000,000,  Collateral: 5,000,000
- ID: 23, Loan ID: LN202508197377, Amount: 10,000,000, Collateral: 5,000,000
- ID: 32, Loan ID: LN202508191192, Amount: 40,000,000, Collateral: 8,000,000
```

## Expected Behavior Now

### For Top-up Loans:
1. **Step 1**: User selects "Top-up" loan type
2. **Loan Selection**: Only shows loans with existing collateral
3. **Loan Selection**: When user selects a loan, existing guarantor/collateral data is automatically loaded
4. **Step 2**: Existing collateral is displayed in summary table
5. **Form Fields**: Remain empty for additional collateral input
6. **Validation**: Enhanced coverage checks including existing + additional collateral
7. **Guarantor Type**: "Self Guarantee" is pre-selected by default
8. **Database**: `loan_type` = "TOPUP", `loan_type_2` = "Top-up"

### For Restructure Loans:
1. **Step 1**: User selects "Restructure" loan type
2. **Loan Selection**: Only shows loans with existing collateral
3. **Loan Selection**: When user selects a loan, existing guarantor/collateral data is automatically loaded
4. **Step 2**: Existing collateral is displayed in summary table
5. **Form Fields**: Remain empty for additional collateral input
6. **Validation**: Enhanced coverage checks including existing + additional collateral
7. **Guarantor Type**: "Self Guarantee" is pre-selected by default
8. **Database**: `loan_type` = "RESTRUCTURED", `loan_type_2` = "Restructure"

### For Other Loan Types:
- **New**: Clean form, no existing data, "Self Guarantee" pre-selected, `loan_type` = "New", `loan_type_2` = "New"
- **Takeover**: Clean form, no existing data, "Self Guarantee" pre-selected, `loan_type` = "TAKEOVER", `loan_type_2` = "Takeover"

## Database Queries Used

### Top-up Loan Filtering:
```sql
SELECT * FROM loans 
WHERE client_number = '10003' 
AND status IN ('ACTIVE', 'PENDING')
AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM loan_guarantors lg
    JOIN loan_collaterals lc ON lg.id = lc.loan_guarantor_id
    WHERE lg.loan_id = loans.id
    AND lg.status = 'active'
    AND lc.status = 'active'
)
```

### Existing Guarantor Data Loading:
```sql
SELECT * FROM loan_guarantors 
WHERE loan_id = [selected_loan_id]
```

### Existing Collateral Data Loading:
```sql
SELECT lc.* FROM loan_collaterals lc
JOIN loan_guarantors lg ON lc.loan_guarantor_id = lg.id
WHERE lg.loan_id = [selected_loan_id]
```

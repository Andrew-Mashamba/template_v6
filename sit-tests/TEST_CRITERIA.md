# SIT Test Pass/Fail Criteria

## Overview
This document defines the criteria used to determine whether each System Integration Test (SIT) passes or fails.

## General Pass Criteria

A test is considered **PASSED** when ALL of the following conditions are met:

### 1. Connectivity & Response
- ‚úÖ **Response Received**: The API must return a response (not timeout or connection refused)
- ‚úÖ **Valid HTTP Status Code**: Response must have a valid HTTP status code
- ‚úÖ **Response Time**: Response received within maximum allowed time (default: 30 seconds)

### 2. Response Validation
- ‚úÖ **Expected Status Code**: HTTP status matches expected (e.g., 200 for success)
- ‚úÖ **Response Format**: Response is in expected format (JSON/XML)
- ‚úÖ **Required Fields**: All mandatory fields present in response
- ‚úÖ **Success Indicator**: Response contains success indicator field with correct value

### 3. Data Integrity
- ‚úÖ **Transaction ID**: Valid transaction/reference ID returned (for transactional APIs)
- ‚úÖ **Data Types**: Response fields have correct data types
- ‚úÖ **Business Rules**: Response adheres to business logic rules

## Test Categories

### Positive Tests
Tests that verify normal, expected behavior:
- Must receive a successful response
- Status code should be 2xx (success)
- Response must contain valid data
- All required fields must be present

### Negative Tests
Tests that verify error handling:
- Must receive an error response
- Status code should match expected error (4xx or 5xx)
- Error message must be meaningful
- Should not crash or timeout

## Failure Conditions

A test is considered **FAILED** when ANY of the following occur:

### Critical Failures
- ‚ùå No response received (timeout/connection refused)
- ‚ùå Unexpected HTTP status code
- ‚ùå Missing required fields in response
- ‚ùå Invalid response format (not JSON/XML when expected)
- ‚ùå Success indicator shows failure when success expected

### Performance Failures
- ‚ùå Response time exceeds maximum allowed
- ‚ùå API returns timeout error
- ‚ùå Connection dropped during request

### Data Failures
- ‚ùå Missing or invalid transaction ID
- ‚ùå Incorrect data types in response
- ‚ùå Business logic violations
- ‚ùå Calculation errors

## Test Result Classification

### PASSED ‚úÖ
- All criteria met
- Response received within time limit
- Expected data returned
- No errors encountered

### FAILED ‚ùå
- One or more criteria not met
- Unexpected response or error
- Performance requirements not met
- Data validation failed

### ERROR üî¥
- Exception thrown during test
- Connection failure
- Timeout occurred
- Unexpected system error

### WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Test passed but with concerns
- Performance near threshold
- Deprecated API usage detected
- Non-critical validation issues

## Logging Requirements

For each test, the following MUST be logged:

### Request Details
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15 10:30:45",
  "test_name": "IFT Transaction",
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "https://api.bank.com/ift-transaction",
  "headers": {...},
  "body": {...}
}
```

### Response Details
```json
{
  "response_received": true,
  "status_code": 200,
  "response_time_ms": 1234,
  "headers": {...},
  "body": {...},
  "error": null
}
```

### Test Result
```json
{
  "test_passed": true,
  "criteria_checked": ["Response Received", "Status Code", "Required Fields"],
  "failures": [],
  "warnings": []
}
```

## Usage Example

```php
// Evaluate test results
$testResult = [
    'response_received' => true,
    'status_code' => 200,
    'response_time_ms' => 1500,
    'response_body' => [
        'status' => 'success',
        'transaction_id' => 'TXN123456'
    ]
];

$evaluation = TestCriteria::evaluate(
    'BankTransactionService',
    'IFT Transaction',
    $testResult
);

if ($evaluation['passed']) {
    echo "‚úÖ Test PASSED\n";
} else {
    echo "‚ùå Test FAILED\n";
    foreach ($evaluation['failures'] as $failure) {
        echo "  - $failure\n";
    }
}
```

## Reporting

Each test run generates:
1. **Detailed Logs**: Complete request/response data
2. **Summary Report**: Pass/fail statistics
3. **Performance Metrics**: Response times and throughput
4. **Error Analysis**: Detailed failure reasons

## Continuous Improvement

Test criteria should be reviewed and updated:
- When API specifications change
- When performance requirements change
- When new validation rules are added
- Based on production incident analysis

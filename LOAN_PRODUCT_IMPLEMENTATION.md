# Loan Product Implementation

## Overview
Updated the Ongoing Loans table in the member view to:
- **Replace "Type" header with "Product"**
- **Show loan product name** from the `loan_sub_products` table
- **Use relationship**: `loans.loan_sub_product` → `loan_sub_products.product_id`

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Setup

#### Created Sample Product Data:
- **BUSINESS LOAN** (ID: 731205) - Used by loans 1752821326 and 1752819821
- **PERSONAL LOAN** (ID: 1) - Used by loan LOAN00006
- **SALARY ADVANCE** (ID: 2) - Available for future loans

### 2. Model Relationships

#### Created `app/Models/LoanSubProduct.php`:
```php
class LoanSubProduct extends Model
{
    protected $table = 'loan_sub_products';
    protected $guarded = [];

    public function loans()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Loan::class, 'loan_sub_product', 'product_id');
    }
}
```

#### Updated `app/Models/Loan.php`:
```php
public function loanProduct()
{
    return $this->belongsTo(LoanSubProduct::class, 'loan_sub_product', 'product_id');
}
```

#### Updated `app/Models/LoansModel.php`:
```php
public function loanProduct(): BelongsTo
{
    return $this->belongsTo(LoanSubProduct::class, 'loan_sub_product', 'product_id');
}
```

### 3. View Updates

#### Updated `resources/views/livewire/clients/view-member.blade.php`:
```php
// Header change
<th class="py-1 px-2 text-left">Product</th>  // Changed from "Type"

// Data display change
<td class="py-1 px-2">{{ $loan->loanProduct->sub_product_name ?? 'N/A' }}</td>  // Changed from $loan->loan_type
```

### 4. Component Updates

#### Updated `app/Http/Livewire/Clients/AllMembers.php`:
```php
$this->viewingMember = ClientsModel::with([
    'loans.schedules', 
    'loans.loanAccount',
    'loans.loanProduct',  // Added this relationship
    'bills', 
])->find($id);
```

## Testing Results

### Sample Data Verification:
```php
Member: GONZA LO
Loan: LOAN00006
Product: PERSONAL LOAN          // New Product column
Principal: 2,000,000.00        // Amount column
Account Balance: 50,000.00     // Balance column
```

### Relationship Testing:
- ✅ Loan model has `loanProduct` relationship
- ✅ LoansModel has `loanProduct` relationship
- ✅ Eager loading works correctly
- ✅ View displays correct product names

## Database Schema

### Loans Table
- `loan_sub_product`: References product_id in loan_sub_products table

### Loan Sub Products Table
- `product_id`: Primary key for product identification
- `sub_product_name`: Product name (displayed in Product column)
- `sub_product_status`: Product status (ACTIVE/INACTIVE)

## Usage Examples

### Accessing Loan Product:
```php
// Get loan with product information
$loan = Loan::with('loanProduct')->find($loanId);
$productName = $loan->loanProduct->sub_product_name ?? 'N/A';

// Get member with loans and product information
$member = ClientsModel::with(['loans.loanProduct'])->find($memberId);
foreach ($member->loans as $loan) {
    echo "Loan: " . $loan->loan_id;
    echo "Product: " . ($loan->loanProduct->sub_product_name ?? 'N/A');
}
```

### View Display:
```php
// In Blade template
<td>{{ $loan->loanProduct->sub_product_name ?? 'N/A' }}</td>  // Product column
```

## Files Modified

1. **`app/Models/LoanSubProduct.php`** - New model for loan sub products
2. **`app/Models/Loan.php`** - Added loanProduct relationship
3. **`app/Models/LoansModel.php`** - Updated loanProduct relationship
4. **`resources/views/livewire/clients/view-member.blade.php`** - Updated header and data display
5. **`app/Http/Livewire/Clients/AllMembers.php`** - Added eager loading
6. **`create-sample-product-data.php`** - Script to create sample product data

## Benefits

### 1. Accurate Product Information
- **Product Column**: Shows actual loan product names instead of generic "Type"
- **Real Data**: Uses database relationships instead of hardcoded values

### 2. Proper Relationships
- Loans are properly linked to their corresponding products
- Eager loading prevents N+1 query problems

### 3. Data Consistency
- Uses actual database relationships
- Maintains referential integrity

### 4. Scalability
- Works with any number of loan products
- Automatically handles missing relationships gracefully

## Current Product Data

### Available Products:
- **BUSINESS LOAN** (ID: 731205) - For business financing
- **PERSONAL LOAN** (ID: 1) - For personal financing
- **SALARY ADVANCE** (ID: 2) - For salary advances

### Loan-Product Mappings:
- **Loan 1752821326** → BUSINESS LOAN
- **Loan 1752819821** → BUSINESS LOAN
- **Loan LOAN00006** → PERSONAL LOAN

## Future Enhancements

1. **Product Management**: Add admin interface to manage loan products
2. **Product Categories**: Group products by categories
3. **Product Features**: Add product-specific features and requirements
4. **Product Analytics**: Track loan performance by product type

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Test loan product relationship
php artisan tinker --execute="
\$loan = App\Models\Loan::with('loanProduct')->first();
echo 'Loan: ' . \$loan->loan_id . PHP_EOL;
echo 'Product: ' . (\$loan->loanProduct->sub_product_name ?? 'N/A') . PHP_EOL;
"

# Test member view with products
php artisan tinker --execute="
\$member = App\Models\ClientsModel::where('client_number', '00006')
    ->with(['loans.loanProduct'])->first();
if(\$member && \$member->loans->count() > 0) {
    \$loan = \$member->loans->first();
    echo 'Product: ' . (\$loan->loanProduct->sub_product_name ?? 'N/A') . PHP_EOL;
}
"
```

The implementation is now complete and the Ongoing Loans table will display accurate Product information from the loan_sub_products table.

## Test Execution Guidelines

### Daily Execution Process
1. **Morning Setup** (30 minutes)
   - Review previous day's results
   - Prepare test data for current day
   - Verify environment status

2. **Test Execution** (6-7 hours)
   - Execute assigned test cases
   - Document results immediately
   - Take screenshots for failures
   - Log defects in tracking system

3. **End of Day Review** (30 minutes)
   - Review test results
   - Update test metrics
   - Plan next day's activities

### Defect Management
- **Critical**: System crashes, data loss, security breaches
- **High**: Core functionality not working, incorrect calculations
- **Medium**: Minor functionality issues, UI problems
- **Low**: Cosmetic issues, minor enhancements

### Test Result Documentation
- **Pass**: Test case executed successfully, expected result achieved

## üéØ UAT Testing Overview

### What is UAT?
User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is the final phase of testing where end users validate that the system meets their business requirements and is ready for production use.

### Testing Scope
The UAT covers **8 main modules** with **35 test cases**:

1. **Member Management** (6 test cases)
2. **Savings Management** (4 test cases)
3. **Share Management** (3 test cases)
4. **Loans Management** (5 test cases)
5. **Accounting & Finance** (8 test cases)
6. **Reports Management** (6 test cases)
7. **User & Security** (4 test cases)
8. **System** (9 test cases)

### Test Case Priority Levels
- **Critical** (15 test cases): Must pass for system acceptance
- **High** (12 test cases): Important functionality
- **Medium** (8 test cases): Standard functionality

## üöÄ Getting Started with UAT

### Prerequisites
1. **Test Environment Setup**
   - Dedicated UAT environment configured
   - Sample data loaded for all modules
   - Test user accounts with appropriate permissions
   - Integration with external systems (banks, MNOs)

2. **Test Team Preparation**
   - Testers assigned to specific modules
   - Access credentials provided
   - Test data requirements understood

### Test Execution Process

#### Step 1: Test Planning
1. Review the `UAT_Test_Cases.md` document
2. Understand test case requirements and expected results
3. Set up test execution tracking using the template

#### Step 2: Test Execution
1. **For each test case:**
   - Follow the detailed test steps
   - Document actual results
   - Mark status as PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED/NOT TESTED
   - Record any defects found

2. **Test Case Status Tracking:**
   - **PASS**: Test case executed successfully
   - **FAIL**: Test case failed, defect found
   - **BLOCKED**: Cannot execute due to blocking issues
   - **NOT TESTED**: Not yet executed

#### Step 3: Defect Management
1. **For failed test cases:**
   - Document detailed defect information
   - Include steps to reproduce
   - Attach screenshots if applicable
   - Assign severity level (Critical/High/Medium/Low)

2. **Defect Severity Levels:**
   - **Critical**: System crash, data loss, security breach
   - **High**: Major functionality not working
   - **Medium**: Minor functionality issues
   - **Low**: Cosmetic issues, minor improvements

#### Step 4: Test Reporting
1. **Daily Progress Reports:**
   - Number of test cases executed
   - Pass/Fail statistics
   - New defects found
   - Blocking issues

2. **Final UAT Report:**
   - Overall test execution summary
   - Defect summary and status
   - Recommendations for go/no-go decision

## üìã Test Execution Guidelines

### Best Practices
1. **Test Data Management**
   - Use dedicated test accounts
   - Maintain data integrity
   - Document test data used

2. **Test Case Execution**
   - Execute test cases in priority order
   - Follow test steps exactly as documented
   - Document any deviations or issues

3. **Defect Reporting**
   - Report defects immediately
   - Provide clear, detailed descriptions
   - Include all relevant information

4. **Communication**
   - Regular updates to stakeholders
   - Escalate blocking issues promptly
   - Maintain test execution logs

### Test Environment Requirements

#### System Requirements
- **Web Interface**: Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Mobile App**: iOS 12+, Android 8+
- **USSD**: Standard USSD gateway integration
- **API**: RESTful API endpoints for external integrations

#### Data Requirements
- **Member Data**: Sample members with various statuses
- **Account Data**: Savings, loan, and share accounts
- **Transaction Data**: Historical transactions for testing
- **Product Data**: Loan products, savings products, share products

#### Integration Requirements
- **Bank Integration**: Test bank accounts and APIs
- **MNO Integration**: Mobile money integration (M-Pesa, Airtel Money, etc.)
- **SMS Gateway**: For notifications and alerts
- **Email Service**: For email notifications

## üìä Test Metrics and Reporting

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Test Execution Progress**
   - Total test cases: 35
   - Executed: [Number]
   - Passed: [Number]
   - Failed: [Number]
   - Blocked: [Number]

2. **Defect Metrics**
   - Total defects found
   - Defects by severity
   - Defects by module
   - Defect resolution status

3. **Quality Metrics**
   - Test case pass rate
   - Critical test case pass rate
   - Defect density per module

### Sign-off Criteria
The system is ready for production when:
- ‚úÖ All critical test cases PASS
- ‚úÖ No high-severity defects remain open
- ‚úÖ Performance requirements are met
- ‚úÖ Security requirements are validated
- ‚úÖ Business stakeholders approve

## üîß Tools and Resources

### Recommended Tools

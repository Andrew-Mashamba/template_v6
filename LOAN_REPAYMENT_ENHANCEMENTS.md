# Loan Repayment System Enhancements

## Date: August 18, 2025

## Overview
This document summarizes the enhancements made to the loan repayment system, including fixes from testing and comprehensive logging implementation.

## 1. Database Enhancements

### Added Fields to `loan_sub_products` Table
- **`early_settlement_waiver`** (DECIMAL 5,2): Percentage of interest to waive for early settlement (0-100)
- **`penalty_max_cap`** (DECIMAL 10,2): Maximum penalty amount cap

### Migration File
- Location: `database/migrations/2025_08_18_090343_add_early_settlement_waiver_to_loan_sub_products_table.php`
- Status: ✅ Migrated successfully

4. **💵 Overpayment detected** - When payment exceeds outstanding
5. **📊 Payment allocation completed** - After FIFO allocation
6. **📅 Loan schedules updated** - After updating schedule records
7. **📑 Accounting transactions processed** - After GL postings
8. **📝 Payment history recorded** - After saving payment record

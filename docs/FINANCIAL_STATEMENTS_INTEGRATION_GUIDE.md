## 1. OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

### Primary Financial Statements:
1. **Statement of Financial Position (Balance Sheet)**
   - Shows financial position at a specific point in time
   - Equation: Assets = Liabilities + Equity

2. **Statement of Comprehensive Income (P&L)**
   - Shows financial performance over a period
   - Equation: Revenue - Expenses = Net Income

3. **Statement of Cash Flows**
   - Shows cash movements over a period
   - Categories: Operating, Investing, Financing

4. **Statement of Changes in Equity**
   - Shows changes in ownership interest
   - Links opening and closing equity balances

## 2. ACCOUNTING ELEMENTS IMPACT ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

### A. STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION (BALANCE SHEET)

#### ASSETS SECTION

##### 1. Trade and Other Receivables
- **Classification**: Current Asset
- **GL Account**: 1000-1500 (Accounts Receivable)
- **Impact**: 
  - Increases assets when sales are made on credit
  - Decreases when payments are received
  - Bad debt provisions reduce net receivables
- **Formula**: Gross Receivables - Bad Debt Provision = Net Receivables
- **Integration Points**:
  ```sql
  -- Get total receivables
  SELECT SUM(amount - COALESCE(amount_paid, 0)) as outstanding_receivables
  FROM trade_receivables 
  WHERE status = 'active'
  ```

##### 2. Investments

## 3. INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS

### A. General Ledger Integration

All accounting elements must post to the General Ledger:

```php
// Example GL posting for Trade Receivables
public function postToGL($transaction)
{
    // Debit: Trade Receivables
    DB::table('general_ledger')->insert([
        'account_code' => '1000-1500', // Trade Receivables
        'debit' => $transaction->amount,
        'credit' => 0,
        'description' => $transaction->description,
        'transaction_date' => $transaction->date,
        'reference' => $transaction->reference_number
    ]);
    
    // Credit: Revenue or Cash
    DB::table('general_ledger')->insert([
        'account_code' => $transaction->is_cash ? '1000-1000' : '4000-4100',
        'debit' => 0,
        'credit' => $transaction->amount,
        'description' => $transaction->description,
        'transaction_date' => $transaction->date,
        'reference' => $transaction->reference_number
    ]);
}
```

### B. Period-End Adjustments

### C. Consolidation Rules

#### Balance Sheet Equation Must Balance:
```php
$totalAssets = $this->calculateTotalAssets();
$totalLiabilities = $this->calculateTotalLiabilities();
$totalEquity = $this->calculateTotalEquity();

$isBalanced = abs($totalAssets - ($totalLiabilities + $totalEquity)) < 0.01;
```

#### Income Statement to Balance Sheet Link:
```php
// Net Income flows to Retained Earnings
$netIncome = $totalRevenue - $totalExpenses;
$retainedEarnings += $netIncome - $dividends;
```

Net Profit = Operating Profit + Other Income - Interest - Tax
```

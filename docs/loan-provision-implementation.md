# Comprehensive Loan Provision Management System

## Overview
A complete IFRS 9 Expected Credit Loss (ECL) provision system has been implemented for the SACCOS Core System, replacing the traditional incurred loss model with a forward-looking approach.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. IFRS 9 ECL Model
- **3-Stage Classification System**:
  - **Stage 1**: Performing loans (12-month ECL)
  - **Stage 2**: Underperforming with SICR (Lifetime ECL)
  - **Stage 3**: Non-performing/Credit-impaired (Lifetime ECL)

- **ECL Calculation**: `ECL = PD × LGD × EAD`
  - **PD** (Probability of Default): Risk-adjusted based on client history
  - **LGD** (Loss Given Default): Collateral and guarantor adjusted
  - **EAD** (Exposure at Default): Outstanding balance + undrawn commitments

### 2. Provision Methods
- **IFRS 9 Method**: Full ECL model implementation
- **Regulatory Method**: Traditional classification-based provisioning
- **Hybrid Method**: Higher of IFRS 9 and regulatory (conservative approach)

### 3. Forward-Looking Adjustments
- **Economic Scenarios**:
  - Optimistic: -20% provision adjustment
  - Base Case: No adjustment
  - Pessimistic: +30% provision adjustment
- **SICR Indicators**:
  - Quantitative: Days past due, PD increase, credit score deterioration
  - Qualitative: Restructuring, business changes, forbearance

### 4. Comprehensive Features

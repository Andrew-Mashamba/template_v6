# Loan Approval System

## Overview

The Loan Approval System is integrated into the existing approvals workflow as a modal interface. When approvers click "View Details" on loan-related approval requests, they see a comprehensive assessment summary that allows them to approve or reject loans with proper documentation.

## Features

### 1. Integrated Approval Workflow
- **Access**: Via existing approvals page
- **Trigger**: Click "View Details" on loan approval requests
- **Process Codes**: LOAN_DISB, LOAN_APP, LOAN_REST, LOAN_WOFF
- **Functionality**: 
  - Shows assessment summary in modal
  - Allows approval/rejection with comments
  - Integrates with existing approval workflow

### 2. Assessment Summary Modal
When an approver clicks "View Details" on a loan request, they see:

#### Loan Information
- Client Number and Name
- Loan Amount and Type
- Application Date
- Current Status
- Loan Terms and Conditions

#### Member Details
- Personal Information
- Contact Details
- Employment Information
- Credit History

#### Guarantor Information (if applicable)

- Financial Capacity

#### Approval Actions
- **Approve**: Process the loan approval
- **Reject**: Reject with detailed reason
- **Comment**: Add approval/rejection comments

### 3. Enhanced Loan Processing

#### What Happens When Loans Are Approved/Rejected

The system now includes comprehensive loan processing similar to other processes like share withdrawals:

##### **Loan Disbursement (LOAN_DISB)**
When **Approved**:
- ✅ Updates loan status to `DISBURSED`
- ✅ Sets disbursement date and disbursed by user
- ✅ Creates disbursement transaction record
- ✅ Updates client loan account balance
- ✅ Sends disbursement notification
- ✅ Logs all actions for audit trail

When **Rejected**:
- ❌ Updates loan status to `DISBURSAL_REJECTED`
- ❌ Stores rejection reason with timestamp
- ❌ Sends rejection notification

##### **Loan Application (LOAN_APP)**
When **Approved**:
- ✅ Updates loan status to `APPROVED`
- ✅ Sets approval date and approved by user
- ✅ Sends approval notification
- ✅ Logs approval action

When **Rejected**:
- ❌ Updates loan status to `REJECTED`
- ❌ Stores rejection reason
- ❌ Sends rejection notification

##### **Loan Restructuring (LOAN_REST)**
When **Approved**:
- ✅ Updates loan status to `RESTRUCTURED`
- ✅ Sets restructuring date and restructured by user
- ✅ Applies restructuring changes from edit_package
- ✅ Sends restructuring notification

When **Rejected**:
- ❌ Updates loan status to `RESTRUCTURE_REJECTED`
- ❌ Stores rejection reason

##### **Loan Write-off (LOAN_WOFF)**
When **Approved**:
- ✅ Updates loan status to `WRITTEN_OFF`
- ✅ Sets write-off date and written off by user
- ✅ Creates write-off transaction record
- ✅ Sends write-off notification

When **Rejected**:
- ❌ Updates loan status to `WROFF_REJECTED`
- ❌ Stores rejection reason

### 4. Comparison with Other Processes

#### **Share Withdrawal (SHARE_WD)**
```php
'SHARE_WD' => [
    'table' => 'share_withdrawals',
    'approval_status' => 'APPROVED',
    'rejection_status' => 'REJECTED'
]
```
- **When Approved**: Updates `share_withdrawals` table + calls `processApprovedWithdrawal()`
- **Special Processing**: Additional business logic for share processing

#### **Loan Disbursement (LOAN_DISB)**
```php
'LOAN_DISB' => [
    'table' => 'loans',
    'approval_status' => 'DISBURSED',
    'rejection_status' => 'DISBURSAL_REJECTED'
]
```
- **When Approved**: Updates `loans` table + calls `processLoanDisbursement()`
- **Special Processing**: Transaction creation, balance updates, notifications

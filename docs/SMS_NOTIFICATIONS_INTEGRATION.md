## Usage Examples

### Sending Loan Disbursement Notifications

```php
use App\Jobs\ProcessMemberNotifications;

// Dispatch notification job
ProcessMemberNotifications::dispatch(
    $member,           // Member object
    $guarantor,        // Guarantor object (optional)
    $controlNumbers,   // Array of control numbers
    $paymentLink       // Payment link (optional)
);
```

### Direct SMS Service Usage

```php
use App\Services\SmsService;
use App\Services\SmsTemplateService;

$smsService = new SmsService();
$templateService = new SmsTemplateService();

// Generate loan disbursement SMS
$message = $templateService->generateLoanDisbursementMemberSMS(
    'John Doe',
    5000000,  // Loan amount
    500000,   // Monthly installment
    'CN123456789',  // Control number
    'https://pay.nbcsaccos.co.tz/loan/123'  // Payment link
);

// Send SMS
$result = $smsService->send(
    '255653123456',  // Phone number
    $message,        // SMS message
    $member,         // Recipient object
    [
        'smsType' => 'LOAN_DISBURSEMENT',
        'serviceName' => 'LOAN_REPAYMENT',
        'language' => 'English'
    ]
);
```

### Bulk SMS Sending

```php
$recipients = [
    ['phone' => '255653123456', 'name' => 'John Doe'],
    ['phone' => '255754789012', 'name' => 'Jane Smith'],
];

$message = "Dear members, your loan disbursements are ready. Please check your accounts.";

$result = $smsService->sendBulk(
    $recipients,
    $message,
    [
        'smsType' => 'BULK',
        'serviceName' => 'LOAN_REPAYMENT'
    ]
);
```

## Message Length Management

### Character Limits
- **Single SMS**: 160 characters
- **Multi-part SMS**: Automatically split by NBC SMS Engine
- **Recommended**: Keep messages under 160 characters for cost efficiency

### Template Validation
```php
$templateService = new SmsTemplateService();

$message = "Your long message here...";
$validation = $templateService->validateMessageLength($message);

// Result:
// [
//     'valid' => false,
//     'length' => 180,
//     'segments' => 2,
//     'max_length' => 160
// ]
```

## Error Handling

### SMS Failure Handling
- SMS failures don't stop email notifications
- Failed SMS are logged with detailed error information
- Retry logic is built into the SmsService
- Rate limiting prevents API abuse

### Logging
All SMS operations are logged with:
- Process ID for tracking
- Phone numbers (masked for privacy)
- Success/failure status
- Error messages and stack traces
- NBC API response data

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Notification Logs
```php
use App\Models\NotificationLog;

// Get SMS statistics
$smsStats = NotificationLog::byChannel('sms')
    ->where('created_at', '>=', now()->subDays(30))
    ->selectRaw('status, COUNT(*) as count')
    ->groupBy('status')
    ->get();
```

### Success Rates
- Track delivery success rates
- Monitor failed notifications
- Analyze SMS vs Email performance
- Identify common failure patterns

## Security and Privacy

### Phone Number Formatting
- Automatic country code formatting (255 for Tanzania)
- Validation of phone number format
- Rate limiting per phone number

### Data Protection
- Phone numbers logged in masked format
- SMS content logged for debugging only
- No sensitive data in SMS messages

# AI Reasoning Agent Documentation

## Overview

The AI Reasoning Agent is an advanced implementation that transforms the traditional static query processing into a dynamic, interactive reasoning system. Instead of generating all SQL queries at once, the LLM can now think, ask questions, and iterate through data analysis step-by-step.

## Key Features

### üß† **Interactive Reasoning Loop**
- **THINK**: The LLM analyzes what it knows and what it needs
- **SQL**: Generates specific queries to gather required data
- **ANSWER**: Provides final comprehensive answers after analysis

### üîÑ **Multi-Step Analysis**
- Iterative data exploration
- Context-aware query generation
- Progressive reasoning with data feedback

### üõ°Ô∏è **Enhanced Security**
- Read-only operations (SELECT only)
- Query timeout protection
- Result set size limits
- Comprehensive logging

### üìä **Performance Analytics**
- Reasoning efficiency scoring
- Step-by-step analysis
- Performance optimization suggestions

## How It Works

### 1. **Question Analysis**
```php
$question = "Which clients took loans in the last 3 months and have balances over 5 million?";
$result = $aiAgent->processRequest($question);
```

### 2. **Table Identification**
The agent identifies relevant database tables:
- `clients` - for client information
- `loans` - for loan data
- `accounts` - for balance information

### 3. **Reasoning Loop Execution**
The LLM goes through multiple reasoning steps:

#### Step 1: Initial Thinking
```
THINK: I need to find clients who took loans recently. Let me first check the loans table structure and see what data I can get about recent loans.
```

#### Step 2: Data Query
```
SQL: SELECT client_id, loan_amount, disbursed_date, balance FROM loans WHERE disbursed_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '3 months' LIMIT 100;
```

#### Step 3: Analysis
```
THINK: Now I have recent loans. I need to filter those with balance > 5 million and get the client names.
```

#### Step 4: Follow-up Query
```
SQL: SELECT c.name, c.id, l.loan_amount, l.balance FROM clients c JOIN loans l ON c.id = l.client_id WHERE l.disbursed_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '3 months' AND l.balance > 5000000 LIMIT 100;
```

#### Step 5: Final Answer
```
ANSWER: Based on the data, the clients who took loans in the last 3 months and have balances over 5 million are: Alice John (ID: 123, Balance: 7.2M), Ibrahim Musa (ID: 456, Balance: 6.8M), and Fatuma Ally (ID: 789, Balance: 5.5M).
```

## API Usage

### Basic Usage
```php
use App\Services\AiAgentService;

$aiAgent = new AiAgentService();

// Process a question with reasoning
$result = $aiAgent->processRequest("How many clients do we have and what's their average loan amount?");
```

### Response Structure
```php
[
    'response' => 'Final answer from the AI',
    'original_query' => 'Original question',
    'sql_queries' => ['SELECT queries executed'],
    'sql_results' => ['Query results'],
    'reasoning_steps' => [
        [
            'step' => 1,
            'action' => 'THINK',
            'content' => 'Reasoning content'
        ],
        [
            'step' => 2,
            'action' => 'SQL',
            'content' => 'SELECT query'
        ],
        [
            'step' => 3,
            'action' => 'ANSWER',
            'content' => 'Final answer'
        ]
    ],
    'timestamp' => '2024-01-01 12:00:00',
    'method' => 'reasoning_loop',
    'relevant_tables' => ['clients', 'loans'],
    'table_schemas' => ['table schemas']
]
```

### Reasoning Mode Control
```php
// Enable/disable reasoning mode
$aiAgent->setReasoningMode(true);  // Enable reasoning
$aiAgent->setReasoningMode(false); // Disable reasoning (fallback to SQL-first)

// Check current mode
$isEnabled = $aiAgent->isReasoningEnabled();
```

### Performance Analysis
```php
// Get reasoning statistics
$stats = $aiAgent->getReasoningStats($result['reasoning_steps']);

// Analyze reasoning efficiency
$efficiency = $aiAgent->analyzeReasoningEfficiency($result['reasoning_steps'], $result['response']);

// Get comprehensive summary
$summary = $aiAgent->getReasoningSummary(
    $result['reasoning_steps'],
    $result['sql_queries'],
    $result['sql_results'],
    $result['response']
);
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
TOGETHER_API_KEY=your_together_api_key
```

### Service Configuration
```php
// In config/services.php
'groq' => [
    'api_key' => env('GROQ_API_KEY'),
],
'openai' => [
    'api_key' => env('OPENAI_API_KEY'),
],
'together' => [
    'api_key' => env('TOGETHER_API_KEY'),
],
```

## Safety Features

### SQL Security
- **Read-only operations**: Only SELECT queries allowed
- **Dangerous keyword detection**: Blocks INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.
- **Query timeout**: 30-second timeout per query
- **Result limits**: Automatic LIMIT 100 for large result sets

### Error Handling
- **Graceful degradation**: Falls back to traditional SQL-first approach
- **Comprehensive logging**: All operations logged for audit
- **Exception handling**: Robust error handling with detailed messages

## Performance Optimization

### Loop Limits
- **Maximum steps**: 10 reasoning steps per question
- **Timeout protection**: Prevents infinite loops
- **Memory management**: Efficient data handling

### Caching
- **Provider health**: Cached for 5 minutes
- **Schema information**: Cached for performance
- **Query results**: Not cached (always fresh data)

## Use Cases

### 1. **Complex Financial Analysis**
```php
$question = "What's the total value of loans in arrears and which clients are affected?";
```

### 2. **Multi-Table Queries**
```php
$question = "Show me clients who took loans in the last 3 months and have balances over 5 million";
```

### 3. **Trend Analysis**
```php
$question = "Which branches have the highest transaction volumes this month?";
```

### 4. **Risk Assessment**
```php
$question = "What's the average loan amount by client category and which categories have the highest default rates?";
```

# Expense-Budget Integration Documentation

## Overview
The expense module has been fully integrated with the enhanced budget management system, providing comprehensive budget tracking, allocation management, and intelligent expense approval workflows.

## Key Features

### 1. Enhanced Budget Checking
- **Real-time Budget Validation**: Every expense is checked against monthly budget allocations
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Includes base allocation, rollovers, advances, and supplementary budgets
- **Intelligent Options**: System suggests alternatives when budget is exceeded:
  - Use rollover from previous months
  - Request advance from future months
  - Transfer from other budget items
  - Request supplementary budget

### 2. Budget Allocation Tracking
- **Monthly Allocations**: Expenses are tracked against specific monthly allocations
- **Automatic Updates**: When expenses are approved, allocations are automatically updated
- **Utilization Tracking**: Real-time tracking of budget utilization percentages

### 3. Integration Points

#### Database Changes
- Added `budget_allocation_id` to expenses table for direct allocation linking
- Created index on `budget_item_id` and `expense_month` for faster queries

#### Service Layer
- **EnhancedBudgetCheckingService**: Comprehensive budget validation with allocation awareness
- **BudgetFlexibilityService**: Handles advances, rollovers, and supplementary requests
- **BudgetMonitoringService**: Automatic alerts for budget thresholds

#### Event Handling
- **UpdateBudgetAllocationOnExpenseApproval**: Automatically updates allocations when expenses are approved
- Triggers budget alerts for:
  - High utilization (>80%)
  - Budget exceeded (>100%)
  - Low utilization at month end (<50%)

### 4. User Interface Enhancements

#### Expense Submission
- Real-time budget checking before submission
- Visual indicators for budget status
- Options for handling budget overruns
- Detailed budget information display

#### Dashboard Integration
- Current month budget overview
- Breakdown showing rollover and advances
- Real-time available budget calculation
- Visual utilization indicators

## Workflow

### Standard Expense Flow
1. User selects expense account and enters amount
2. System checks budget allocation for current month
3. If within budget: Direct submission
4. If over budget: Show available options
5. User selects resolution (rollover/advance/supplementary)
6. Expense submitted with budget resolution
7. Upon approval: Allocation automatically updated

### Budget Resolution Options

#### Using Rollover
- System checks previous months for unused budget
- Automatically applies if policy allows
- Updates rollover tracking

#### Requesting Advance
- Borrows from future month allocations
- Creates repayment schedule
- Tracks advance status

#### Supplementary Request
- Creates formal supplementary budget request
- Routes through approval workflow
- Updates allocation upon approval

## Configuration

### Rollover Policies
- **AUTOMATIC**: Unused budget automatically rolls over
- **APPROVAL_REQUIRED**: Rollover needs approval
- **NO_ROLLOVER**: Unused budget expires

### Alert Thresholds
- Warning: 80% utilization
- Critical: 100% utilization
- Info: <50% utilization at month end

## API Methods

### Check Budget
```php
$service = new EnhancedBudgetCheckingService();
$result = $service->checkBudgetForExpense($accountId, $amount, $month);
```

```php
$service->processBudgetResolution($expenseId, 'USE_ROLLOVER', $data);
$service->processBudgetResolution($expenseId, 'REQUEST_ADVANCE', $data);
$service->processBudgetResolution($expenseId, 'REQUEST_SUPPLEMENTARY', $data);
```

### Update Tracking

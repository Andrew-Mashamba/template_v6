âœ… Takeaway:
For AI-driven accounting software, each IAS offers:

Rules â†’ Constraints the system must enforce

Disclosures â†’ Data AI can auto-fill or validate

Judgements â†’ Areas where AI can assist with predictive models (e.g., impairment, fair value, provisions)

ðŸ‘‰ Would you like me to design a system architecture (modules & AI features mapped to IAS standards) so you can see how these would sit inside your accounting software?

Thought for 11s
Iasâ€‘driven Accounting System Build Spec (for A Coding Ai)
IASâ€‘Driven Accounting System Build Spec (for a Coding AI)

Purpose: give a coding AI precise, buildable directions to implement an IFRS/IASâ€‘compliant general ledger and subâ€‘ledgers. Each IAS section includes Scope â†’ Data Model â†’ Rules/Algorithms â†’ APIs â†’ Validations â†’ Tests.

Scope of standards covered: IAS 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 12, 16, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 32, 33, 34, 36, 37, 38, 40, 41. (Use IFRS references where IAS crossâ€‘linksâ€”e.g., IFRS 9 for instrument measurementâ€”but keep this doc IASâ€‘anchored.)

0) Foundational Architecture (applies to all IAS)

Core Principles

Doubleâ€‘entry, immutable ledger. No hard deletes; corrections via reversing entries and adjusting entries.

Eventâ€‘sourced postings; each transaction has origin_module, evidence_ref, prepared_by, approved_by, posted_at.

Periods: OPEN â†’ SOFT_CLOSED (adjustments allowed) â†’ HARD_CLOSED (locked). Close maintains an audit trail.

Multiâ€‘entity, multiâ€‘currency, multiâ€‘GAAP via configuration.

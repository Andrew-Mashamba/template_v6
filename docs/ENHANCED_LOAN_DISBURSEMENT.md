# Enhanced Loan Disbursement System

## Overview

The enhanced loan disbursement system now comprehensively handles all types of deductions and additional amounts that may be applied during loan disbursement. This includes charges, insurance, first interest, top-up scenarios, outside loan settlements, and loan restructuring.

## Key Features

### 1. Comprehensive Deduction Handling

The system now calculates and processes the following deductions:

#### Standard Deductions
- **Charges**: Administration fees, processing fees, etc.
- **Insurance**: Loan assurance, credit life insurance, etc.
- **First Interest**: Interest from disbursement date to first regular installment

#### Additional Deductions
- **Top-Up Amount**: For loans that are topping up existing loans
- **Closed Loan Balance**: Outstanding balance from previous loans being closed
- **Outside Loan Settlements**: Settlements to external institutions (e.g., AKIBA)
- **Restructuring Amount**: Additional amount for restructured loans

### 2. Net Disbursement Calculation

```php
$netDisbursementAmount = $approvedLoanValue - $totalDeductions

$totalDeductions = $charges + $insurance + $firstInterest + 
                   $topUpAmount + $closedLoanBalance + 
                   $outsideSettlements + $restructuringAmount
```

### 3. Enhanced Transaction Processing

The system now processes all deductions as separate transactions:

- **Charges Transaction**: Debits charges collection account, credits fees account
- **Insurance Transaction**: Debits charges collection account, credits insurance account
- **First Interest Transaction**: Debits interest account, credits interest income account
- **Outside Settlements Transaction**: Debits loan account, credits loan account (settlement)
- **Top-Up Transaction**: Debits loan account, credits loan account (top-up processing)
- **Restructuring Transaction**: Debits loan account, credits loan account (restructuring)

## Implementation Details

### Core Methods

#### 1. `calculateAllDeductions($loan)`

Calculates all deductions and returns a comprehensive breakdown:

```php
return [
    'total_deductions' => $totalDeductions,
    'net_disbursement_amount' => $netDisbursementAmount,
    'breakdown' => [
        'charges' => $chargesAmount,
        'insurance' => $insuranceAmount,
        'first_interest' => $firstInterestAmount,
        'top_up_amount' => $topUpAmount,
        'closed_loan_balance' => $closedLoanBalance,
        'outside_settlements' => $outsideSettlements,
        'restructuring_amount' => $restructuringAmount
    ],
    'charges_amount' => $chargesAmount,
    'insurance_amount' => $insuranceAmount,
    'first_interest_amount' => $firstInterestAmount,
    'top_up_amount' => $topUpAmount,
    'closed_loan_balance' => $closedLoanBalance,
    'outside_settlements' => $outsideSettlements,
    'restructuring_amount' => $restructuringAmount
];
```

#### 2. `processAllLoanTransactions()`

Processes all loan-related transactions including deductions:

```php
private function processAllLoanTransactions(
    $loanAccountCode, 
    $interestAccountCode, 
    $chargesAccountCode, 
    $insuranceAccountCode, 
    $deductions
)
```

#### 3. `validateSufficientFunds($netDisbursementAmount)`

Validates that the disbursement account has sufficient funds for the net disbursement amount.

### Deduction Calculation Methods

#### Top-Up Amount Calculation
```php
private function calculateTopUpAmount($loan)
{
    if (!$this->selectedLoan) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    $topUpLoan = DB::table('loans')->where('id', $this->selectedLoan)->first();
    return $topUpLoan->amount_to_be_credited ?? 0;
}
```

#### Closed Loan Balance Calculation
```php
private function calculateClosedLoanBalance($loan)
{
    if (!$loan->loan_account_number) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    return DB::table('sub_accounts')
        ->where('account_number', $loan->loan_account_number)
        ->value('balance') ?? 0;
}
```

#### Outside Settlements Calculation
```php
private function calculateOutsideSettlements($loan)
{
    $settledLoans = DB::table('settled_loans')
        ->where('loan_id', $loan->id)
        ->where('is_selected', true)
        ->get();
    
    $totalSettlements = 0;
    foreach ($settledLoans as $settledLoan) {
        $totalSettlements += $settledLoan->amount ?? 0;
    }
    
    return $totalSettlements;
}
```

#### Restructuring Amount Calculation
```php
private function calculateRestructuringAmount($loan)
{
    if ($loan->loan_type_2 !== 'RESTRUCTURING') {
        return 0;
    }
    
    $originalLoan = DB::table('loans')
        ->where('id', $loan->restructured_loan_id ?? 0)
        ->first();
    
    if (!$originalLoan) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    return max(0, $this->approved_loan_value - ($originalLoan->approved_loan_value ?? 0));
}
```

## Database Schema Requirements

### Loans Table
The loans table should include the following fields for proper deduction handling:

```sql
ALTER TABLE loans ADD COLUMN net_disbursement_amount DECIMAL(15,2) DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE loans ADD COLUMN total_deductions DECIMAL(15,2) DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE loans ADD COLUMN monthly_installment DECIMAL(15,2) DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE loans ADD COLUMN top_up_loan_id BIGINT NULL;
ALTER TABLE loans ADD COLUMN restructured_loan_id BIGINT NULL;
ALTER TABLE loans ADD COLUMN restructuring_amount DECIMAL(15,2) DEFAULT 0;
```

### Settled Loans Table
For outside loan settlements:

```sql
CREATE TABLE settled_loans (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    loan_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    institution_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    account_number VARCHAR(50),
    amount DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL,
    is_selected BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (loan_id) REFERENCES loans(id)
);
```

## UI Components

2. **Insufficient Funds**: Prevents disbursement if account balance is insufficient
3. **Missing Data**: Validates all required information before processing
4. **Transaction Failures**: Rolls back all changes if any transaction fails

## Logging

All disbursement operations are logged with detailed information:

```php
Log::info('Loan disbursement completed successfully', [
    'loan_id' => $loanID,
    'member_name' => $member->present_surname,
    'payment_method' => $payMethod,
    'net_disbursement_amount' => $deductions['net_disbursement_amount'],
    'total_deductions' => $deductions['total_deductions'],
    'execution_time_seconds' => round($executionTime, 3),
    'user_id' => auth()->id(),
    'accounts_created' => [
        'loan_account' => $loanAccount->account_number,

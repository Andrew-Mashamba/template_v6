API Authentication
For external fund transfer api, NBC supports the following authentication methods:
1. BASIC Authentication
This authentication uses the http header AUTHORIZATION with BASIC realm encoding 
username and password using Base64. i.e.
NBC-Authorization: Basic Base64(username:password).
So the third party need to provide both username and password.
2. Digital Signature
Digital signature will be used for messages exchange between the gatway and channel
System. The channel system will be required to apply for digital signature from Certificate 
Authority (CA). Digital signatures will also be used for message(s) sharing. Message(s) 
must previously be signed by the Participant’s private key and verified using participant’s 
Public Key. The supported signature algorithm is SHA256withRSA, the whole payload 
should be signed, and the signature to be placed on corresponding headers.
3. API Key
The x-api-key header is required for all incoming requests to the API. It contains the API 
key used by authorized channel consumers to authenticate their access. This key acts as a 
security measure to ensure that only approved channels can interact with the API.

# Loan Application Form Enhancement

## Overview

The loan application form in `resources/views/livewire/dashboard/front-desk.blade.php` has been enhanced to capture comprehensive information needed for the loan assessment and disbursement processes. This ensures a complete data flow from application to disbursement.

## Enhanced Fields Added

### 1. Loan Term
- **Field**: `tenure`
- **Type**: Number input
- **Default**: 12 months
- **Range**: 1-60 months
- **Purpose**: Determines loan duration for interest calculations and repayment schedules

### 2. Collateral Information
- **Field**: `collateral_type`
- **Type**: Select dropdown
- **Options**: Land, Building, Vehicle, Equipment, Guarantor, None
- **Purpose**: Identifies loan security type for risk assessment

#### Conditional Fields (based on collateral_type):
- **collateral_value**: Numeric value of collateral (for physical assets)
- **collateral_description**: Text description of collateral details
- **guarantor**: Full name of guarantor (when collateral_type = 'Guarantor')

### 3. Enhanced Payment Method Details

#### For NBC Bank (internal_transfer):
- **bank5**: Bank selection from database
- **bankAcc**: Account number

#### For Mobile Money (tips_mno):
- **mno**: Mobile network operator selection
- **LoanPhoneNo**: Phone number for mobile money

#### For Other Banks (tips_bank):

- **tips_bank_account**: Bank account number

## Data Flow Integration

### 1. Loan Application → Assessment Component

The enhanced form now provides:

```php
// Key fields passed to assessment
'tenure' => $this->tenure ?? 12,
'collateral_type' => $this->collateral_type,
'collateral_value' => $this->collateral_value,
'collateral_description' => $this->collateral_description,
'guarantor' => $this->guarantor,
'bank_account_number' => $this->pay_method === 'internal_transfer' ? $this->bankAcc : 
                       ($this->pay_method === 'tips_bank' ? $this->tips_bank_account : null),
'bank' => $this->pay_method === 'internal_transfer' ? DB::table('banks')->where('id', $this->bank5)->value('bank_name') :
        ($this->pay_method === 'tips_bank' ? $this->tips_bank_code : null),
'phone_number' => $this->pay_method === 'tips_mno' ? $this->LoanPhoneNo : null,
```

### 2. Assessment Component → Disbursement Modal

The assessment component (`app/Http/Livewire/Loans/Assessment.php`) uses this data to:

- Calculate loan terms and monthly installments
- Assess collateral value for risk evaluation
- Prepare payment method details for disbursement
- Generate comprehensive loan calculations

### 3. Disbursement Modal Integration

The disbursement modal (`resources/views/livewire/accounting/loans-disbursement.blade.php`) receives:

- **Payment method details**: Pre-populated from application
- **Loan calculations**: From assessment component
- **Account information**: For disbursement processing
- **Validation data**: To ensure all required information is present

## Key Benefits

## Form Validation Rules

```php

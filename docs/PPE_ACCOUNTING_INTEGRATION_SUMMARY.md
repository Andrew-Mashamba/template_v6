## Key Features

### Transaction Posting Service Integration
All transactions use the centralized `TransactionPostingService::postTransaction()` method which:
1. Validates account existence
2. Updates account balances
3. Records in general_ledger table
4. Maintains audit trail
5. Ensures double-entry balance

### Account Configuration
Accounts are pulled from the institutions table with intelligent fallbacks:
- Primary: Institution-specific account configurations
- Fallback: Default chart of accounts

### Error Handling
All implementations include:
- Database transactions with rollback capability
- Comprehensive error logging
- User-friendly error messages
- Validation before posting

## Accounting Principles Applied

### Double-Entry Rules
1. **Assets increase:** Debit
2. **Assets decrease:** Credit
3. **Expenses increase:** Debit
4. **Liabilities increase:** Credit
5. **Equity increase:** Credit
6. **Revenue increase:** Credit

### First Account vs Second Account
In TransactionPostingService:
- `first_account`: The account being DEBITED
- `second_account`: The account being CREDITED
- Amount is always positive

## Testing Checklist

### Acquisition Testing
- [ ] Create new PPE with purchase price
- [ ] Add additional costs (legal, transport, installation)
- [ ] Verify all costs capitalized to asset account
- [ ] Check general ledger entries

### Disposal Testing
- [ ] Dispose fully depreciated asset
- [ ] Dispose partially depreciated asset
- [ ] Dispose with gain on sale
- [ ] Dispose with loss on sale
- [ ] Verify GL entries for each scenario

### Maintenance Testing
- [ ] Record routine maintenance (expensed)
- [ ] Record capital improvement (capitalized)
- [ ] Verify correct account posting

### Transfer Testing
- [ ] Internal transfer (no GL entry)
- [ ] Inter-company transfer (with GL entry)
- [ ] Verify location/custodian updates

### Insurance Testing
- [ ] Add new insurance policy
- [ ] Pay insurance premium
- [ ] Verify prepaid/expense posting

### Revaluation Testing
- [ ] Upward revaluation (appreciation)
- [ ] Downward revaluation (impairment)
- [ ] Verify reserve/loss accounts

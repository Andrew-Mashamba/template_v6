## Core Components

### Cash Hierarchy Structure

The banking cash management system operates through a hierarchical structure designed to ensure efficient distribution and control:

- **Central Vault** - Main repository at headquarters or central bank location, holding the institution's primary cash reserves
- **Branch Vaults** - Secure storage facilities at each branch location for daily operational needs
- **Teller Tills/Drawers** - Working cash stations for customer-facing transactions
- **ATM Cassettes** - Automated dispensing units for 24/7 customer access
- **Cash in Transit** - Secured money transportation between locations

### System Architecture

Modern cash management systems utilize a multi-layered architecture:
- Front Office operations (teller systems)
- Back Office processing (reconciliation and reporting)
- Head Office oversight (centralized monitoring and control)
- Integration with RTGS (Real-Time Gross Settlement) systems
- Connection protocols via TCP/IP for real-time updates

## Daily Operations Workflow

### Morning Procedures

1. **Opening Balance Verification**
   - Tellers verify beginning cash balance matches previous day's closing
   - System balance confirmation against physical count
   - Documentation of starting denominations

2. **Cash Requisition**
   - Forecast daily cash requirements based on historical patterns
   - Buy cash from vault based on expected needs
   - Plan denomination mix for efficient operations

3. **Drawer Preparation**
   - Count and document all denominations
   - Organize bills and coins in designated slots
   - Verify system entries match physical cash

### During Business Hours

**Transaction Processing:**
- Execute customer deposits and withdrawals
- Maintain accurate system entries for every transaction
- Double-count all cash movements
- Issue receipts with denomination details

**Cash Flow Management:**
- Monitor till limits throughout the day (typically $3,000-$10,000)
- Sell excess cash to vault when approaching limits
- Buy additional denominations when running low
- Document all inter-teller transfers with dual signatures

**Security Protocols:**
- No personal account transactions by tellers
- Restricted access to cash areas
- Continuous camera surveillance
- Immediate reporting of discrepancies

### End-of-Day Settlement

1. **Drawer Balancing**
   - Count all cash twice for verification
   - Run calculator tapes on all checks
   - Verify totals against system records
   - Document any overages or shortages

2. **Reconciliation**
   - Complete daily balancing procedures
   - Generate settlement reports
   - Submit cash to vault with documentation
   - Secure all cash in approved storage

3. **Reporting**
   - File daily cash position reports
   - Document any incidents or exceptions
   - Update denomination requirements for next day

## Cash Limits and Controls

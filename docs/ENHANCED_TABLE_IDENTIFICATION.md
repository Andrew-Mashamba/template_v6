# Enhanced Table Identification System

## Overview

The AI reasoning agent now uses a comprehensive table index system that provides rich context for better table identification. This addresses the issue where table names alone don't provide enough information about their contents.

## Key Components

### 1. Comprehensive Table Index

Each table in the system now has a detailed index entry containing:

- **Description**: What the table contains
- **Keywords**: Related terms and synonyms
- **Fields**: Column names and their purposes
- **Sample Queries**: Common questions that use this table
- **Data Patterns**: What kind of data is stored

### 2. Enhanced AI Prompting

The AI now receives rich context including:
- Table descriptions
- Keyword mappings
- Field information
- Sample query patterns
- Data pattern descriptions

### 3. Improved Fallback Logic

When AI identification fails, the system uses:
- Keyword matching against the comprehensive index
- Sample query pattern matching
- Field name analysis

## Example Table Index Entry

```php
'clients' => [
    'description' => 'SACCO members and customers with comprehensive personal and financial information',
    'keywords' => ['client', 'member', 'customer', 'sacco member', 'account holder', 'member registration'],
    'fields' => ['id', 'name', 'member_number', 'phone', 'email', 'address', 'status', 'registration_date'],
    'sample_queries' => ['members', 'clients', 'member count', 'registered members', 'active members'],
    'data_patterns' => 'Contains member personal information, contact details, and registration status'
]
```

## Benefits

### 1. Better Query Understanding
- AI can now understand that "members" refers to the "clients" table
- "savings products" maps to both "accounts" and "charges" tables
- Field names help identify relevant tables for specific data needs

### 2. Improved Accuracy
- Keywords provide multiple ways to match queries to tables
- Sample queries show common use cases
- Data patterns explain what information is available

### 3. Enhanced Fallback
- When AI fails, keyword matching provides reliable alternatives
- Sample query patterns help identify relevant tables
- More comprehensive coverage of edge cases

## Usage

### For Table Identification
```php
$aiAgent = new AiAgentService();
$tables = $aiAgent->identifyRelevantTables("How many members do we have?");
// Returns: ['clients']
```

### For Getting Table Index
```php
$tableIndex = $aiAgent->getTableIndex();
// Returns comprehensive index for all tables
```

## Supported Query Types

The enhanced system now better handles:

1. **Member Queries**: "members", "clients", "customers"
2. **Product Queries**: "savings products", "loan products", "insurance"
3. **Financial Queries**: "transactions", "accounts", "charges"
4. **Organizational Queries**: "branches", "departments", "employees"
5. **Operational Queries**: "loans", "shares", "budgets"

## Configuration

The table index is defined in the `getTableIndex()` method and can be extended by:

1. Adding new table entries
2. Enhancing keywords for better matching
3. Adding more sample queries
4. Updating field descriptions

## Testing

Use the test script to verify table identification:
```bash
php test_enhanced_table_identification.php
```

This will test various query types and show which tables are identified for each.
